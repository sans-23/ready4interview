            Networking is a fundamental part of system design: you're nearly always going to be designing systems comprised of independent devices that communicate over a network. But the field of networking is vast and complex, and it's easy to get lost (this was one of the heaviest textbooks in school, gross).
          </p>
          <p>
            In this guide we're going to cover the most important parts of networking that you'll need to know for your system design interviews. In later deep dives, patterns, and problem breakdowns, we'll build on these basics to solve for the problems you'll face as you design your systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, we'll start with the fundamentals of how networks operate, then examine key protocols at different layers of the networking stack. For each concept, we'll cover its purpose, how it works, and when to apply it in your system designs. Lots to cover so let's get to it!
          </p>

            <p>
              Networking tends to be a stronger focus in infrastructure and distributed systems interviews. For full-stack and product-focused roles, you'll likely only need a surface understanding of networking concepts. Understanding these fundamentals will help you make better decisions, even if the minute details aren't going to be tested in your interviews.

          <p>
            At its core, networking is about connecting devices and enabling them to communicate. Networks are built on a layered architecture (the so-called "OSI model") which greatly simplifies the world for us application developers who sit on top of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effectively, network layers are just abstractions that allow us to reason about the communication between devices in simpler terms relevant to our application. This way, when you're requesting a webpage, you don't need to know which voltages represent a 1 or a 0 on the network wire (modern networking hardware is even more sophisticated than this!) — you just need to know how to use the next layer down the stack. Think of it like how you might use <span className="inline-code">open</span> in your language of choice instead of manually instructing the disk how to read bytes off a disk.

          <p>
            While the full networking stack is fascinating, there are three key layers that come up most often in system design interviews. We're going to dive into each of them in a bit, but first let's talk about what these layers do and how they work together.
          </p>

          <h3>Network Layer (Layer 3)</h3>
          <p>
            At this layer is IP, the protocol that handles routing and addressing. It's responsible for breaking the data into packets, handling packet forwarding between networks, and providing best-effort delivery to any destination IP address on the network. While there are other protocols at this layer (like InfiniBand, which is used extensively for massive ML training workloads), IP by far the most common for system design interviews.
          </p>

          <h3>Transport Layer (Layer 4)</h3>
          <p>
            At this layer, we have TCP, QUIC, and UDP, which provide end-to-end communication services. Think of them like a layer that provides features like reliability, ordering, and flow control on top of the network layer.
          </p>

          <h3>Application Layer (Layer 7)</h3>
          <p>
            At the final layer are the application protocols like DNS, HTTP, Websockets, WebRTC. These are common protocols that build on top of TCP (or UDP, in the case of WebRTC) to provide a layer of abstraction for different types of data typically associated with web applications. We'll cover them in depth.
          </p>
          <p>
            These layers work together to enable all our network communications. To see how they interact in practice, let's walk through a concrete example of how a simple web request works.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you type a URL into your browser, several layers of networking protocols spring into action. Let's break down how these layers work together to retrieve a simple web page over HTTP on TCP.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we use DNS to convert a human-readable domain name like <span className="inline-code">ouii.com</span> into an IP address like <span className="inline-code">32.42.52.62</span>. Then, a series of carefully orchestrated steps begins. We set up a TCP connection over IP, send our HTTP request, get a response, and tear down the connection.

          <Callout type="info" title="Classic Interview Question">
            <p>
              It's less common recently in BigTech, but it used to be a popular interview question to ask candidates to dive into the details of "what happens when you type (e.g.) ouii.com into your browser and press enter?".
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              Details like these aren't typically a part of a system design interview but it's helpful to understand the basics of networking. It may save you some headaches on the job!
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <p>
            While the specific details of TCP handshakes and teardowns might seem too esoteric to apply to interviews, there's a few things to observe which we'll build upon:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, as an application developer we are able to simplify our mental models dramatically. The application can take for granted that the data is transmitted with a degree of reliability and ordering: the TCP layer ensures that the data is delivered correctly and in order, and will provide a response to the application if it doesn't arrive. We also never have to concern ourselves with finding a specific server in the world and driving a pulse train of electrons to get there. With DNS, we can look up the IP address, and with IP the various networking hardware between us, our ISP, backbone providers, etc. can route the data to the destination. Nice!
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, while we have one conceptual "request" and "response" here, there were many more packets and requests exchanged between servers to make it happen. All of these introduce latency that we can ignore ... until we can't. The higher in the stack we go, the more latency and processing required. This is relevant for our load balancer discussion shortly!
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally note that the connection between the client and server is a state that both the client and server must maintain. Unless we use features like HTTP keep-alive or HTTP/2 multiplexing, we need to repeat this connection setup process for every request - a potentially significant overhead. This will become important for designing systems which need persistent connections, like those handling Realtime Updates.
          </p>

        {/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
            NETWORK LAYER PROTOCOLS
            ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h2 id="network-layer-protocols">Network Layer Protocols</h2>
          <p>
            The first layer in our journey are the network layer protocols. This layer is dominated by the IP protocol, which is responsible for routing and addressing. In a system, nodes are assigned IPs usually by a DHCP server when they boot up. These IP addresses are arbitrary and only mean something in as much as we tell people about them. If I want to, I can create a private network with my servers and give them any IP address I want, but if you want internet traffic to be able to find them you'll need to use IP addresses that are routable and allocated by a RIR.
          </p>
          <p>
            These assigned IP addresses are called public IPs and are used to identify devices on the internet. The most important thing about them is that internet routing infrastructure is optimized to route traffic between public IPs and knows where they are. Any address starting with 17 (e.g. <span className="inline-code">17.0.0.0</span>) is part of Apple — the backbone of the internet knows that when you want to send a packet to these addresses, you need to send it to their routers.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's a lot more to cover in internet routing but it's not going to be important for our purposes so we'll keep it simple and move up the stack to our next layer: the transport layer.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
            TRANSPORT LAYER PROTOCOLS
            ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h2 id="transport-layer">Transport Layer Protocols</h2>
          <p>
            The transport layer is where we establish end-to-end communication between applications. They give us some guarantees instead of handing us a jumbled mess of packets. The three primary protocols at this layer are TCP, UDP, and QUIC, each with distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different use cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            For most system design interviews, the real choice you'll be faced with is between TCP and UDP. QUIC is a new protocol that aims to provide some of the same benefits of TCP with some modernization and performance benefits. While QUIC is becoming more popular, it's still a relatively new protocol and not yet ubiquitous - for our purposes we'll consider it a better version of TCP but without the same broad baseline of adoption.
          </p>

          <Callout type="tip" title="QUIC & HTTP/3">
            <p>
              Some performance-oriented interviewers will be impressed by your knowledge of modern protocols like QUIC and HTTP/3, but most system design interviewers will want you to spend your time elsewhere in the design!
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h3 id="udp">UDP: Fast but Unreliable</h3>
          <p>
            User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is the machinegun of protocols. It offers few features on top of IP but is very fast. Spray and pray is the right way to think about this. It provides a simpler, connectionless service with no guarantees of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you write an application that receives UDP datagrams, you'll be able to see where they came from (i.e. the source IP address and port) and where they're going (i.e. the destination IP address and port). But that's it! The rest is a binary blob.
          </p>
          <p>Key characteristics of UDP include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Connectionless:</strong> No handshake or connection setup</li>
            <li><strong>No guarantee of delivery:</strong> Packets may be lost without notification</li>
            <li><strong>No ordering:</strong> Packets may arrive in a different order than sent</li>
            <li><strong>Lower latency:</strong> Less overhead means faster transmission</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            No setup sounds great but 2 and 3 kinda suck, so why would you want to use UDP?
          </p>

            UDP is perfect for applications where speed is more important than reliability, such as live video streaming, online gaming, VoIP, and DNS lookups. In these cases the application or client is equipped to handle the occasional packet loss or out of order packet. For VOIP as an example, the client might just drop the occasional packet leading to a hiccup in the audio but overall the conversation is still intelligible. This is vastly preferable to retransmitting those lost packets and clogging up the network with ACKs.

          <Callout type="warning" title="Browser Support for UDP">
            <p>
              Browsers don't have widespread support for UDP yet outside of WebRTC (we'll get into it). If you're thinking about a design which could use UDP (like the spamming of hearts and reactions in Facebook Live Comments), think about what you'll do for your browser-based users. It might be that your app-based users get a real-time UDP stream of reactions while browser-based users a slower, batched HTTP stream which you spread out over time in the UI.

          </Callout>

          <h3 id="tcp">TCP: Reliable but with Overhead</h3>
          <p>
            Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the workhorse of the internet. It provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. It establishes a connection through a three-way handshake (we saw this illustrated above with the HTTP example) and maintains that connection throughout the communication session.
          </p>
          <p>
            This connection is called a "stream" and is a stateful connection between the client and server — it also gives us a basis to talk about ordering: two messages sent in the same stream/connection will arrive in the same order. TCP will ensure that recipients of messages acknowledge their receipt and, if they don't, will retransmit the message until it is acknowledged.
          </p>

          <h4>Key Characteristics of TCP</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Connection-oriented:</strong> Establishes a dedicated connection before data transfer</li>
            <li><strong>Reliable delivery:</strong> Guarantees that data arrives in order and without errors</li>
            <li><strong>Flow control:</strong> Prevents overwhelming receivers with too much data</li>
            <li><strong>Congestion control:</strong> Adapts to network congestion to prevent collapse</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            TCP is ideal for applications where data integrity is critical — that is, basically everything where UDP is not a good fit.
          </p>

          <h3 id="when-to-choose">When to Choose Each Protocol</h3>
          <p>
            In system design interviews, most interviewers will expect you're using TCP by default — it often doesn't need to be directly mentioned. That's good because that's also our recommendation!
          </p>
          <p>
            But you'll be able to earn extra points if you can make the case for a UDP application and not bungle the details. So the question you should be asking yourself is whether UDP is a better fit for your use-case.
          </p>
          <p>You might choose UDP when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Low latency is critical (real-time applications, gaming)</li>
            <li>Some data loss is acceptable (media streaming)</li>
            <li>You're handling high-volume telemetry or logs where occasional loss is acceptable</li>
            <li>You don't need to support web browsers (or you have an alternative for that client)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Modern applications often use both protocols. For example, a web-based video conferencing app might use TCP/HTTP for signaling and authentication but UDP/WebRTC for the actual audio/video streams.
          </p>

          <p>
            The application layer is where most developers spend their time. These protocols define how applications communicate and are built on top of the transport layer protocols we just discussed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically the application layer is processed in "User Space" whereas layers beneath it are processed in the OS kernel in "Kernel Space". This means that the application layer is more flexible and can be more easily modified than lower layers, whereas lower layers are difficult to change but can be very efficient.

          <p>
            Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the de-facto standard for data communication on the web. It's a request-response protocol where clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with the requested data.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request is independent and the server doesn't need to maintain any information about previous requests. This is generally a good thing. In system design you'll want to minimize the surface area of your system that needs to be stateful where possible. Most simple HTTP servers can be described as a function of the request parameters — they're stateless!
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's a simple HTTP request/response. You can actually open up a TCP connection and send an HTTP request/response by hand with netcat (<span className="inline-code">nc</span> on the command line) if you'd like!

          <p>You'll see a few key concepts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Request methods:</strong> GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Status codes:</strong> 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Headers:</strong> Metadata about the request or response</li>
            <li><strong>Body:</strong> The actual content being transferred</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The HTTP request methods and status codes are well-defined and standardized (think of them like enums). It's good to know some of the common ones, but most interviewers aren't going to get into this level of detail except if you're using a RESTful API.
          </p>

          <h4>Common Request Methods</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>GET:</strong> Request data from the server. GET requests should be idempotent and don't have a body.</li>
            <li><strong>POST:</strong> Send data to the server.</li>
            <li><strong>PUT:</strong> Update data on the server.</li>
            <li><strong>PATCH:</strong> Update a resource partially.</li>
            <li><strong>DELETE:</strong> Delete data from the server. DELETE requests should be idempotent.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Common Status Codes</h4>
          <p><strong>Success (2xx)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>200 OK:</strong> The request was successful</li>
            <li><strong>201 Created:</strong> The request was successful and a new resource was created</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Moved (3xx)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>302 Found:</strong> The requested resource has been moved temporarily</li>
            <li><strong>301 Moved Permanently:</strong> The requested resource has been moved permanently</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Client Error (4xx)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>404 Not Found:</strong> The requested resource was not found</li>
            <li><strong>401 Unauthorized:</strong> The request requires authentication</li>
            <li><strong>403 Forbidden:</strong> The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it</li>
            <li><strong>429 Too Many Requests:</strong> The client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Server Error (5xx)</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>500 Server Error:</strong> The server encountered an error</li>
            <li><strong>502 Bad Gateway:</strong> The server received an invalid response from the upstream server</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The headers are much more flexible (think of them like key/value pairs). This flexibility demonstrates the pragmatic design philosophy that underlies much of the HTTP spec.
          </p>

          <Callout type="tip" title="HTTP Headers & Content Negotiation">
            <p>
              HTTP headers are a great example of how to design an interface that is flexible to unknown future use-cases and provides a good lesson for API design. Content negotiation is a perfect case study.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              The HTTP Accepts-Encoding header as an example provides clients a way to indicate they can handle different types of content encoding. This allows servers to provide (e.g.) gzip or br (brotli) encoded responses if they're available. Servers can then respond with the most efficient encoding for that client with <span className="inline-code">Content-Encoding: X</span> providing both backward compatibility and graceful degradation.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <p>
            HTTPS adds a security layer (TLS/SSL) to encrypt communications, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. If you're building a public website you're going to be using HTTPS without exception. Generally speaking this means that the contents of your HTTP requests and responses are encrypted and safe in transit.
          </p>

          <Callout type="warning" title="Don't Trust the Request Body">
            <p>
              While the contents of your HTTPS requests and responses are encrypted, they aren't guaranteed to be generated by your client! Your API should never trust the contents of the request body without validating it. A common mistake is to include the user's ID in the request body and use it to make a database call. If an attacker can change the request body, they can change the user ID and read arbitrary user data. Ouch!
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              This doesn't mean you can't include user IDs in your requests. It just means you need to be able to validate them on the server and your API shouldn't ask for anything you can't trust.
            </p>
          </Callout>
          <p>
            That's HTTP in a nutshell! Now let's talk about how to use it to build APIs.
          </p>
        </section>

        {/* ─── REST ─── */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="rest">REST: Simple and Flexible</h3>
          <p>
            While HTTP can be used directly to build websites, oftentimes system designs are concerned with the communication between services via APIs. For creating these APIs, we have three main paradigms: REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.
          </p>
          <p>
            REST is the most common API paradigm you'll use in system design interviews. It's a simple and flexible way to create APIs that are easy to understand and use. The core principle behind REST is that clients are often performing simple operations against resources (think of them like database tables or files on a server).
          </p>
          <p>
            In RESTful API design, the primary challenge is to model your resources and the operations you can perform on them. RESTful API's take advantage of the HTTP methods or verbs together with some opinionated conventions about the paths and the body of the request. They often use JSON to represent the resources in both the request and response bodies — although it's not strictly required.
          </p>

          <Callout type="tip" title="Core Entities → REST Resources">
            <p>
              If you've followed our Delivery Framework, your Core Entities will oftentimes map directly to the resources in your API. Bonus!
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <p>A simple RESTful API might look like this (where User is a JSON object representing a user):</p>

          <CodeBlock language="http">{`GET /users/{id} -> User`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            Here we're using the HTTP method "GET" to indicate that we're requesting a resource. The <span className="inline-code">{'{id}'}</span> is a placeholder for the resource ID, in this case the user ID of the user we want to retrieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we want to update that user, we can use the HTTP method "PUT" to indicate that we're updating a pre-existing resource.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="http">{`PUT /users/{id} -> User
{
  "username": "john.doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            We can also create new resources by using the HTTP method "POST". We'll include the body the content of the resource we want to create. Note that I'm not specifying an ID here because the server will assign one.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="http">{`POST /users -> User
{
  "username": "stefan.mai",
  "email": "stefan@ouii.com"
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            Finally, resources can be nested to represent relationships between resources. For example, a user might have many posts, so we can represent that relationship by nesting the posts under the user resource.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="http">{`GET /users/{id}/posts -> [Post]`}</CodeBlock>

          <Callout type="info" title="Think Resources, Not Methods">
            <p>
              Many engineers often think in terms of methods like <span className="inline-code">updateUser</span> or <span className="inline-code">startGame</span>. These are operations, not resources, so they're not RESTful.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              In REST, we want to think in terms of resources and the operations you can perform on them. So our <span className="inline-code">updateUser</span> might be <span className="inline-code">PUT /users/{'{id}'}</span> and our <span className="inline-code">startGame</span> might be <span className="inline-code">PATCH /games</span> with <span className="inline-code">{'{ "status": "started" }'}</span>.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            Overall REST is very flexible for a wide variety of use-cases and applications. ElasticSearch uses it to manage documents, configure indexes, and more. Check out that deep dive if you want to see a great example of a RESTful API.
          </p>
          <p>
            REST is not going to be the most performant solution for very high throughput services, and generally speaking JSON is a pretty inefficient format for serializing and deserializing data.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, most applications aren't going to be bottlenecked by request serialization. Like TCP, REST is where we'd suggest you default for your interviews. It's well-understood and a good baseline for building scalable systems. You should reach for GraphQL, gRPC, SSE, or WebSockets if you have specific needs that REST can't meet. For practical REST API design patterns, see our API Design guide.

        {/* ─── GraphQL ─── */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="graphql">GraphQL: Flexible Data Fetching</h3>
          <p>
            GraphQL is a more recent API paradigm (open-sourced circa 2015 by Facebook) that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the problem GraphQL solves: Frequently teams and systems are organized into frontend and backend. As an example, the frontend might be a mobile app and the backend a database-based API.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the frontend team wants to display a new page, they can either (a) cobble together a bunch of different requests to backend endpoints (imagine querying 1 API for a list of users and making 10 API calls to get their details), (b) create huge aggregation APIs which are hard to maintain and slow to change, or (c) write brand new APIs for every new page they want to display. None of these are particularly good solutions but it's easy to run into them with a standard REST API.

          <p>
            Over-fetching is the opposite: when we pack way more than we need in an API response to guard ourselves against future use-cases that we don't have today. It means that APIs take a long time to load and return too much data.
          </p>
          <p>
            And writing brand new APIs for every new page is a nightmare.
          </p>
          <p>
            GraphQL solves these problems by allowing the frontend team to flexibly query the backend for exactly the data they need. The backend can then respond with the data in the shape that the frontend needs it. This is a great fit for mobile apps and other use-cases where you want to reduce the amount of data transferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's an example of a GraphQL query which fetches just the data the frontend needs for a sophisticated page which shows both users with their profiles and groups they're a member of.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="graphql">{`query GetUsersWithProfilesAndGroups($limit: Int = 10, $offset: Int = 0) {
  users(limit: $limit, offset: $offset) {
    id
    username
    //...
    
    profile {
      id
      fullName
      avatar
      // ...
    }
    
    groups {
      id
      name
      description
      // ...
      
      category {
        id
        name
        icon
      }
    }
    
    status {
      isActive
      lastActiveAt
    }
  }
  
  _metadata {
    totalCount
    hasNextPage
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            The graphQL code here is basically specifying which fields and nested objects we want to fetch. The backend can interpret this query and respond with just the data the frontend needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our example, instead of writing a bunch of different APIs, the frontend team can just write a single query to get the data they need and the backend can (in theory) respond with the data in the shape that the frontend needs it.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            GraphQL is a great fit for use-cases where the frontend team needs to iterate quickly and adjust. They can flexibly query the backend for exactly the data they need. On the other hand, execution of these GraphQL queries can be a source of latency and complexity for the backend — sometimes involving the same bespoke backend code that we're trying to avoid. In practice, GraphQL finds its sweet spot with complex clients and when multiple teams are making wide queries to overlapping data.
          </p>
          <p>
            For system design interviews specifically, the benefits of GraphQL are murky. In the interview you'll have a fixed set of requirements (not the moving targets of iterating on a mobile app or web frontend where GraphQL starts to shine). Additionally, the interviewer will frequently want to see how you optimize specific query patterns and while you can talk about custom resolvers — GraphQL is frequently just in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend bringing up GraphQL in cases where the problem is clearly focused on flexibility (e.g. the interviewer tells us we need to be able to adapt our apps quickly to changing requirements) or when the requirements in the interview are deliberately uncertain. For more interview-focused GraphQL guidance, see our API Design article.

          <h3 id="grpc">gRPC: Efficient Service Communication</h3>
          <p>
            gRPC is a high-performance RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework from Google (the "g") that uses HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of Protocol Buffers like JSON but with a more rigid schema that allows for better performance and more efficient serialization. Here's an example of a Protocol Buffer definition for a User resource:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="protobuf">{`message User {
  string id = 1;
  string name = 2;
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>Instead of a chunky JSON object with embedded schema (40 bytes) ...</p>

          <CodeBlock language="json">{`{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe"
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>... we have a binary encoding (15 bytes) of the same data with very skinny tags and variable length encoding of the strings. Less space and less CPU to parse!</p>

          <CodeBlock language="hex">{`0A 03 31 32 33 12 08 6A 6F 68 6E 20 64 6F 65`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>gRPC builds on this to provide service definitions. Here's an example of a gRPC service definition for a UserService:</p>

          <CodeBlock language="protobuf">{`message GetUserRequest {
  string id = 1;
}

message GetUserResponse {
  User user = 1;
}

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (GetUserRequest) returns (GetUserResponse);
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            I probably don't need to explain the details of this to you!
          </p>
          <p>
            These definitions are compiled into a client and server stub which a wide variety of languages and frameworks can consume to build services and clients. gRPC includes a bunch of features relevant for operating microservice architectures at scale (it was invented by Google after all) like streaming, deadlines, client-side load balancing and more. But the most important thing to know is that it's a binary protocol that's faster and more efficient than JSON over HTTP.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            gRPC shines in microservices architectures where services need to communicate efficiently. Its strong typing helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime, and its binary protocol is more efficient than JSON over HTTP (some benchmarks show a factor of 10x throughput!). Consider gRPC for internal service-to-service communication, especially when performance is critical or when latencies are dominated by the network rather than the work the server is doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, you generally won't use gRPC for public-facing APIs, especially for clients you don't control, because it's a binary protocol and the tooling for working with it is less mature than simple JSON over HTTP. Having internal APIs using gRPC and external APIs using REST is a great way to get the benefits of a binary protocol without the complexity of a public-facing API. There are definitely engineers who would love it if gRPC was more widely adopted, but it's not there yet.

          <p>
            As such, we recommend using REST for public-facing APIs and leaving gRPC for internal service-to-service communication — especially if binary data is being exchanged or performance is critical. In many interviews, using REST both for internal and external APIs is fine and you can build from there depending on the needs of the problem and probes from your interviewer.

              Sometimes engineers think the point of a system design interview is to draw up an optimal solution to a problem on a whiteboard. But interviewers typically are trying to understand how you think through a problem and how you react to challenges and constraints you may not have seen before. Be wary of hyperoptimizing your RPC protocol choice before you've handled other substantial bottlenecks in the problem. Premature optimization is the root of all evil!

        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="sse">Server-Sent Events (SSE): Real-Time Push Communication</h3>
          <p>
            So far we've been talking mostly about request/response style APIs, but many applications need to "push" data to clients in a more streaming fashion. While gRPC does support streaming, it's not ideal for external APIs due to limited support (e.g. no browsers support gRPC today). Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a spec defined on top of HTTP that allows a server to push many messages to the client over a single HTTP connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's how to think of it: SSE is a nice hack on top of HTTP that allows a server to stream many messages, over time, in a single response from the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            With most HTTP APIs you'd get a single, cohesive JSON blob as a response from the server that is processed once the whole thing has been received.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="json">{`{
  "events": [
    { "id": 1, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", "description": "Event 1" },
    { "id": 2, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:01Z", "description": "Event 2" },
    ...
    { "id": 100, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:10Z", "description": "Event 100" }
  ]
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            Since we have to wait for the whole response to come in before we can process it, it's not much good for push notifications!
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, with SSE, the server can push many messages as "chunks" in a single response from the server:
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="http">{`data: {"id": 1, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", "description": "Event 1"}
data: {"id": 2, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:01Z", "description": "Event 2"}
...
data: {"id": 100, "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:10Z", "description": "Event 100"}`}</CodeBlock>

          <p>
            Each line here is received as a separate message from the server. The client can then process each message as it comes in. It's still one big HTTP response (same TCP connection), but it comes in over many smaller packets and clients are expected to process each line of the body individually to allow them to react to the data as it comes in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now with all good hacks, SSE comes with some acute limitations. We can't keep an SSE connection open for too long because the server (or the load balancer, or a middle box proxy) will close down the connection. So the SSE standard defines the behavior of an EventSource object that, once the connection is closed, will automatically reconnect with the ID of the last message received. Servers are expected to keep track of prior messages that may have been missed while the client was disconnected and resend them.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice there are also some nasty, misbehaving networks that will batch up all SSE responses into a single response making it behave a lot like what we're trying to avoid. Tradeoffs!
          </p>

          <Callout type="info" title="SSE Limitations in Practice">
            <p>
              Most interviewers are not familiar with these limitations and will gladly let you assume they don't exist. But it's good to be aware of them because anyone who has actually implemented SSE has an enduring headache from these issues and will try to get a sense for whether you've actually used it in practice.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            You'll find SSE useful in system design interviews in situations where you want clients to get notifications or events as soon as they happen. SSE is a great option for keeping bidders up-to-date on the current price of an auction, for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            We touch on this pattern in greater detail in our Realtime Updates deep dive, which also covers the server-side implications of an SSE implementation.

        {/* ─── WebSockets ─── */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="websockets">WebSockets: Real-Time Bidirectional Communication</h3>
          <p>
            Now while SSE is a great way to push from the server to client, many applications need real-time bidirectional communication. And while gRPC does support streaming, it's still (broken record?) not ideal for external APIs due to limited support (e.g. no browsers support gRPC today). So what's an interview candidate to do?
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter WebSockets! WebSockets provide a persistent, TCP-style connection between client and server, allowing for real-time, bidirectional communication with broad support (including browsers). Unlike HTTP's request-response model, WebSockets enable servers to push data to clients without being prompted by a new request. Similarly clients can push data back to the server without the same wait.
          </p>
          <p>
            WebSockets are initiated via an HTTP "upgrade" protocol, which allows an existing TCP connection to change L7 protocols. This is super convenient because it means you can utilize some of the existing HTTP session information (e.g. cookies, headers, etc.) to your advantage.
          </p>

          <Callout type="warning" title="Infrastructure Support Required">
            <p>
              Just because clients can upgrade from HTTP to WebSocket doesn't mean that the infrastructure will support it. Every piece of infrastructure between the client and server will need to support WebSocket connections.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              If you've ever implemented Websockets you've probably hit a bunch of issues with firewalls, proxies, load balancers, and other infrastructure that don't support WebSocket connections.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h4>How it Works</h4>
          <p>Here's how it works:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Client initiates WebSocket handshake over HTTP (with a backing TCP connection)</li>
            <li>Connection upgrades to WebSocket protocol, WebSocket takes over the TCP connection</li>
            <li>Both client and server can send binary messages to each other over the connection</li>
            <li>The connection stays open until explicitly closed</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            WebSockets don't dictate an application protocol, you effectively have a channel where you can send binary packets to the server from the client and vice versa. This means you'll need some way of defining what it is your client and server are exchanging. For many WebSocket applications, simple serialized JSON messages are a great option! This also gives you a chance to define the API of your service for your design:

            WebSockets come up in system design interviews when you need high-frequency, persistent, bi-directional communication between client and server. Think real-time applications, games, and other use-cases where you need to send and receive messages as soon as they happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            For applications where either you just need to be able to send requests and receive responses, or situations where you can make due with the push notifications provided by SSE, WebSockets are overkill.

        {/* ─── WebRTC ─── */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="webrtc">WebRTC: Peer-to-Peer Communication</h3>
          <p>
            The last protocol we'll cover is the most unique. WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer communication between browsers without requiring an intermediary server for the data exchange. WebRTC can be perfect for collaborative applications like document editors and is especially useful for video/audio calling and conferencing applications. Oh, and it's the only application-level protocol we'll cover that uses UDP!
          </p>
          <p>
            The WebRTC spec is comprised of several pieces of infra and protocols that are necessary to establish a peer-to-peer connection between browsers. From a networking perspective, peer-to-peer connections are more complex than the client-server models we've been discussing so far because most clients don't allow inbound connections for security reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            With WebRTC, clients talk to a central "signaling server" which keeps track of which peers are available together with their connection information. Once a client has the connection information for another peer, they can try to establish a direct connection without going through any intermediary servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, most clients don't allow inbound connections for security reasons and the majority of users are behind a NAT (network address translation) device which keeps them from being connected to directly. So if we stopped there, most peers wouldn't be able to "speak" to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            The WebRTC standard includes two methods to work around these restrictions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>STUN:</strong> "Session Traversal Utilities for NAT" is a protocol and a set of techniques like "hole punching" which allows peers to establish publically routable addresses and ports. I won't go into details here, but as hacky as it sounds it's a standard way to deal with NAT traversal and it involves repeatedly creating open ports and sharing them via the signaling server with peers.</li>
            <li><strong>TURN:</strong> "Traversal Using Relays around NAT" is effectively a relay service, a way to bounce requests through a central server which can then be routed to the appropriate peer.</li>
          </ul>

            This is the happy case! In reality, sometimes these connections fail and you need to have fallbacks like our TURN server.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            WebRTC is ideal for audio/video calling and conferencing applications. It can also occasionally be appropriate for collaborative applications like document editors, especially if they need to scale to many clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, most collaborative editors don't require scaling to thousands of clients. Additionally, you often need a central server anyways to store the document and coordinate between clients. That's why we're using Websockets in our Google Docs problem breakdown. But there is an alternative to use WebRTC and CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to achieve a truly peer-to-peer experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            For interviews, we suggest sticking to WebRTC for video/audio calling and conferencing applications.
          </p>

          <Callout type="warning" title="WebRTC Pitfalls in Interviews">
            <p>
              WebRTC is an absolute pain to get right and even the best implementations still suffer connection losses. It truly is a niche solution.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              In interviews, I've seen more candidates go wildly off trail trying to design peer-to-peer systems using WebRTC than I have seen them successfully implement them. Most problems don't require peer-to-peer connections and it's easy to try to wrap a solution around a problem that doesn't actually need it.
            </p>
            <p style={{ marginTop: '8px' }}>
              If you stick to only using WebRTC for video/audio calling and conferencing, you'll be in good shape.

            And with that we've covered the top of our stack and all the relevant protocols you'll see in System Design interviews. But how do we scale our designs? Of course there are networking implications here!
          </p>
          <p>
            For scaling, we have two options: bigger servers (vertical scaling) or more servers (horizontal scaling).

          <p>
            My personal preference is to employ vertical scaling wherever possible. Modern hardware is incredibly powerful and the days of requiring thousands of tiny servers when a few larger ones can handle the load are over (read more about modern hardware capabilities in our Numbers to Know deep dive).
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, the reality for interviews is that the most common pattern for scaling you'll see is horizontal scaling: we're going to add more servers to handle the load. But just adding boxes to our whiteboard won't help if we don't tell our clients which server to talk to.

        {/* ─── Types of Load Balancing ─── */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="types-lb">Types of Load Balancing</h3>
          <p>
            We need to spread the incoming requests (load) by deciding which server should handle each request. There's two ways to handle load balancing: on the client side or on the server side. Both have their pros and cons.
          </p>

          <h3 id="client-side-lb">Client-Side Load Balancing</h3>
          <p>
            With client-side load balancing, the client itself decides which server to talk to. Usually this involves the client making a request to a service registry or directory which contains the list of available servers. Then the client makes a request to one of those servers directly. The client will need to periodically poll or be pushed updates when things change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Client-side load balancing can be very fast and efficient. Since the client is making the decision, it can choose the fastest server without any additional latency. Instead of using a full network hop to get routed to the right server on every request, we only need to (periodically) sync our list of servers with the server registry.
          </p>

          <h4>Example: Redis Cluster</h4>
          <p>
            A great example of this is Redis Cluster (read more in our Redis deep dive). Redis cluster nodes maintain a gossip protocol between each other to share information about the cluster: which nodes are present, their status, etc. Every node knows about every other node!
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to connect to a Redis Cluster, the client will make a request to any of the nodes in the cluster and ask about both the nodes participating in the cluster and the shards of data they contain. When it comes time to read or write data, the client hashes the key to determine which shard to send the request to, then uses the locally retrieved node information to decide which node to talk to. If you send a request to the wrong node, Redis will helpfully send you a <span className="inline-code">MOVED</span> response to let you know you got the wrong node.
          </p>

          <h4>Example: DNS</h4>
          <p>
            Another example of "client-side" load balancing is DNS. When you make a request to a domain name like <span className="inline-code">example.com</span>, your DNS resolver will return a rotated list of IP addresses for the domain. Each new request will get a different ordering of IP addresses (or even a different set entirely).
          </p>
          <p>
            Because each client gets a different ordering of IP addresses, they're also going to hit different servers. The DNS resolver is effectively doing client-side load balancing for us!
          </p>
          <p>
            This behavior of DNS is also how you avoid a single point of failure with a load balancer! You set up two load balancers (in different data centers or regions, to be safe) and use DNS to rotate between them. If one goes down, clients will automatically start trying the other one.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            Client-side load balancing can work great in two different scenarios: either (1) we have a small number of clients that we control, (e.g. the Redis Cluster client, or gRPC's client-side load balancing for internal services) or (2) we have a large number of clients but we can tolerate slow updates (e.g. DNS).
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have a small number of clients that we control, getting them updates when we add or remove servers is easy! There's a lot of mechanisms to do this.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of a large number of clients, the reason we care about the latency of updates is because the amount of time it takes will scale with the number of clients we have to notify. In DNS' case, entries have a TTL (time to live) which is the amount of time the entry is valid for. This allows far-flung DNS servers to cache entries for their own clients, but means that our updates cannot be faster than the TTL.
          </p>

            <p>
              In an interview setting, client-side load balancing works remarkably well for internal microservices (it's actually built in to gRPC). Many interviewers actually aren't asking the details behind the lines between different services on your high-level design, but if you're asked more details about it you should definitely mention client-side load balancing!
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <p>For all other use-cases, we'll need a dedicated load balancer.</p>

        <section className="content-section">
          <h3 id="dedicated-lb">Dedicated Load Balancers</h3>
          <p>
            We may not want our clients to have to refresh their list of servers or even know about the existence of multiple servers on the backend. Or we might have a large number of clients that we don't control but need to retrieve updates quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these cases, we'll use a dedicated load balancer: a server or hardware device that sits between the client and the backend servers and makes decisions about which server to send the request to.

          <p>
            These load balancers can operate at different layers of the protocol stack and which you choose will depend, in part, on what your application needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having a dedicated load balancer implies an additional hop in each request: first to the load balancer, then to the server which needs to serve the request. But in exchange we get very fast updates to our list of servers and fine-grained control over how we route requests.
          </p>

          <h3 id="layer4-lb">Layer 4 Load Balancers</h3>
          <p>
            Layer 4 load balancers operate at the transport layer (TCP/UDP). They make routing decisions based on network information like IP addresses and ports, without looking at the actual content of the packets. The effect of a L4 load balancer is as-if you randomly selected a backend server and assumed that TCP connections were established directly between the client and that server.
          </p>

          {/* L4 LB Diagram */}

              Persistent TCP connection maintained end-to-end
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>Layer 4 load balancers have some key characteristics, they ...</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintain persistent TCP connections between client and server.</li>
            <li>Are fast and efficient due to minimal packet inspection.</li>
            <li>Cannot make routing decisions based on application data.</li>
            <li>Are typically used when raw performance is the priority.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, if a client establishes a TCP connection through an L4 load balancer, that same server will handle all subsequent requests within that TCP session. This makes L4 load balancers particularly well-suited for protocols that require persistent connections, like WebSocket connections. At a conceptual level, it's as if we have a direct TCP connection between client and server which we can use to communicate at higher layers.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            L4 load balancers are great for WebSocket connections and other protocols that require persistent connections. They're also great for high-performance applications that don't require much application-level processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're using websockets in your interview, you probably want to use an L4 load balancer. For everything else, a Layer 7 load balancer is probably a better fit.
          </p>

          <h3 id="layer7-lb">Layer 7 Load Balancers</h3>
          <p>
            Layer 7 load balancers operate at the application layer, understanding protocols like HTTP. They can examine the actual content of each request and make more intelligent routing decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Layer 4 load balancers, the connection-level details are not that relevant. Layer 7 load balancers receive an application-layer request (like an HTTP GET) and forward that request to the appropriate backend server.

            <li>Terminate incoming connections and create new ones to backend servers.</li>
            <li>Can route based on request content (URL, headers, cookies, etc.).</li>
            <li>More CPU-intensive due to packet inspection.</li>
            <li>Provide more flexibility and features.</li>
            <li>Better suited for HTTP-based traffic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, an L7 load balancer could route all API requests to one set of servers while sending web page requests to another (providing similar functionality to an API Gateway), or it could ensure that all requests from a specific user go to the same server based on a cookie. The underlying TCP connection that's made to your server via an L7 load balancer is not the same TCP connection that the client made to the load balancer — the load balancer terminates the client's connection and creates a new one to the backend server.
          </p>

          <h4>Where to Use It</h4>
          <p>
            L7 load balancers are ideal for HTTP-based traffic where you need intelligent routing based on request content. They're also great for SSL termination, where the load balancer handles the encryption/decryption so the backend servers don't have to.
          </p>

          <Callout type="tip" title="L4 vs L7 Decision Guide">
            <p>
              Use L4 when you need persistent connections (WebSockets) or raw throughput. Use L7 when you need content-based routing, SSL termination, or application-level features. In most system design interviews, L7 is the default choice unless you have a specific reason to use L4.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h3 id="health-checks">Health Checks & Fault Tolerance</h3>
          <p>
            Load balancers regularly send health check requests to backend servers. If a server fails to respond, it's removed from the pool and traffic is redirected to healthy servers. This automatic failover is crucial for high availability.
          </p>

          <h3 id="lb-algorithms">Common Load Balancing Algorithms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Round Robin</strong> — Distributes requests sequentially across servers. Simple but doesn't account for server capacity or current load.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong> — Like round robin but assigns more traffic to more powerful servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Least Connections</strong> — Routes to the server with the fewest active connections. Great when request processing times vary.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Hash</strong> — Routes based on the client's IP address, ensuring the same client always reaches the same server (useful for session stickiness).</li>
            <li><strong>Random</strong> — Surprisingly effective for large pools. Simple implementation, statistically balanced.</li>
          </ul>

        <section className="content-section">
          <h2 id="regionalization">Regionalization & Latency</h2>
          <p>
            Data travels at the speed of light through fiber optic cables, but even light takes time. A round trip from New York to Tokyo takes ~150ms just for the network transit. When you add DNS resolution, TCP handshake, TLS negotiation, and server processing, real-world latency can be 300ms+. That's noticeable to users.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reduce latency, we need to keep data <strong>as close to the user as possible</strong>, and keep the data a query needs <strong>as close together as possible</strong>.
          </p>

          <h3 id="cdns">Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</h3>
          <p>
            A CDN is a globally distributed network of edge servers that cache and serve content from locations close to users. When a user in Mumbai requests an image, instead of fetching it from a server in Virginia, the CDN serves it from a nearby edge node in Mumbai — reducing latency from ~300ms to ~20ms.
          </p>
          <p>
            CDNs work because of <strong>content cacheability</strong>. Static assets (images, CSS, JS, videos) are perfect CDN candidates. Some CDNs also support dynamic content caching and edge compute. Popular CDNs include CloudFront (AWS), Cloudflare, and Akamai.
          </p>

          <h3 id="regional-partitioning">Regional Partitioning</h3>
          <p>
            For applications with natural geographic boundaries, you can partition your entire infrastructure by region. Take Uber: a rider in Mumbai will never book a driver in Delhi. This means each city (or region) can have its own database, application servers, and caches — all co-located in nearby data centers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This reduces cross-region database calls, improves latency, and allows each region to scale independently based on local demand.

            HANDLING FAILURES
            ═══════════════════════════════════════════════ */}
        <section className="content-section">
          <h2 id="failure-handling">Handling Failures & Fault Modes</h2>
          <p>
            The fallacy of "the network is reliable" is one of the most dangerous assumptions in distributed systems. Servers crash, cables get cut, routers fail, and packets get dropped. Robust system design requires planning for these failures.
          </p>

          <h3 id="timeouts-retries">Timeouts & Retries with Backoff</h3>
          <p>
            The most fundamental strategy for handling transient failures is <strong>timeouts</strong> combined with <strong>retries</strong>. If a request doesn't complete within a timeout, give up and try again. Having a small number of retries (typically 3) with reasonable timeouts handles most transient failures gracefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            But retries can be a double-edged sword. If all clients retry simultaneously, you create a <strong>thundering herd</strong> that makes the problem worse. This is why retry strategies include <strong>exponential backoff</strong> — each retry waits longer than the previous one (e.g., 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s).
          </p>
          <p>
            Adding <strong>jitter</strong> (randomness) to the backoff prevents all clients from retrying at the exact same time. Without jitter, your retries can synchronize into a periodic hammer that keeps hitting the struggling server.
          </p>

          <CodeBlock language="javascript">{`// Retry with exponential backoff and jitter
async function fetchWithRetry(url, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, { 
        signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) // 5s timeout
      });
      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      
      // Exponential backoff with jitter
      const baseDelay = Math.pow(2, attempt) * 1000;
      const jitter = Math.random() * 1000;
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, baseDelay + jitter));
    }
  }
}`}</CodeBlock>

          <h3 id="idempotency">Idempotency</h3>
          <p>
            Retries are great — except when they have side effects. Imagine a payment system where you charge a user $10. If the request times out and you retry, you might charge them $20 instead of $10!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is why APIs need to be <strong>idempotent</strong> — making the same request multiple times should produce the same result as making it once. Read operations (GET) are naturally idempotent. For write operations, a common approach is to use an <strong>idempotency key</strong>: a unique identifier the client includes with the request. The server checks if it has already processed a request with that key and avoids processing it again.
          </p>

          <Callout type="info" title="Idempotency Key Example">
            <p>
              For a payment, the idempotency key might be a combination of user ID + order ID. On the server side, before processing the payment, check if a payment with that key already exists. If it does, return the existing result instead of charging again. Stripe, for example, supports idempotency keys on all POST requests.
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <h3 id="circuit-breakers">Circuit Breakers</h3>
          <p>
            When a downstream service goes down completely, retrying will only make things worse. A <strong>circuit breaker</strong> — inspired by electrical circuit breakers — detects repeated failures and "trips," temporarily stopping all requests to the failing service. This gives the failing service time to recover without being hammered by requests.
          </p>
          <p>Circuit breakers have three states:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Closed (normal)</strong> — Requests flow through normally. Failures are counted.</li>
            <li><strong>Open (tripped)</strong> — After failures exceed a threshold, the circuit opens. All requests immediately fail-fast without hitting the downstream service.</li>
            <li><strong>Half-Open (testing)</strong> — After a cooldown period, a few test requests are allowed through. If they succeed, the circuit closes. If they fail, it stays open.</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="diagram-container">
            <div className="diagram-title">Circuit Breaker States</div>

              <div className="diagram-arrow diagram-arrow--bidirectional">↕ Success → Close | Failure → Open</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>
            Circuit breakers prevent <strong>cascading failures</strong> — where one failing service causes a chain reaction that brings down the entire system. They're especially useful in front of databases, third-party APIs, and any service that can become a bottleneck.

              <li><strong>TCP vs UDP:</strong> Default to TCP for reliability. Use UDP when speed matters more than perfection. QUIC bridges both worlds.</li>
              <li><strong>Application Protocols:</strong> Default to REST for APIs. Use gRPC for internal microservices. Use SSE for server-push, WebSockets for bidirectional real-time, GraphQL for flexible client-driven queries.</li>
              <li><strong>Load Balancing:</strong> L4 for raw throughput and persistent connections, L7 for intelligent routing. Use health checks for fault tolerance.</li>
              <li><strong>Reduce Latency:</strong> Use CDNs for cacheable content. Regional partitioning for geographically bounded data.</li>
              <li><strong>Handle Failures:</strong> Timeouts + retries with exponential backoff and jitter. Idempotency keys for safe retries. Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.</li>

            Networking decisions impact every aspect of your system — from latency and throughput to reliability and security. In your interviews, be prepared to justify your networking choices based on the specific requirements. There's rarely a single right answer; interviewers want to see how you think through tradeoffs.
